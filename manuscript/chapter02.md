## StandupTooLong

### Fragile Pattern

There is no magic behind "15 minutes". A good 15-minute standup can in fact feel (and be) shorter than a bad 10-minute one.

Stand-ups, also known by their other name, scrum, are the team's opportunity to align on how they are going to come together as a team and figure out how to make solid progress towards the sprint goal.

This alignment can take longer than 15 minutes, but it rarely requires everyone on the team to be present to figure it out. And so the recommended guideline is for each person to share with everyone else what they could complete since last time they met, what they are planning to accomplish today, what is blocking them, and how expect to make progress.

### Why this is an anti-pattern

When stand-ups systemically take too long, it's natural for team members to tune out or even stop attending. At that point the team is no longer working as a team, but as a group of individuals reporting on the fact that they have been busy and deserve their paycheck.

Instead of a team of 6 people (for example), where when one person is in trouble, the whole team is in trouble, long stand-ups are a sign that we now have a 6 teams of one person, where other people's problems are not anyone else's problems.

### How to avoid it

Keep the stand-ups focused. No more than a minute per person. Ensure that everyone now knows what everyone else's challenges are, let them organize their day based on the new information, and reassess the next day.

Since standing up for long periods of time no longer hurts in this era of height-adjustable desks, try something different. Whomever speaks stands on one foot for example. Or have the stand-up in the parking lot during winter time. In other words, give the team an incentive to stay focused, yet informative.

## ReportStatusStandup

### Fragile Pattern

Where the daily standup (sometimes also known as "the daily scrum") becomes nothing but a status report. In this scenarion, each person indicates how busy they have been and how busy they plan on being today. This is not very interesting to the other team members, even though it might be interesting to a manager, especially a micro-manager.

A much better day for the daily standup is daily scrum. The latter is a better name because the purpose of the meeting is right there in the name, daily, and scrum.

Daily is self-explanatory, and scrum will feel more familiar to rugby fans. A (rugby) scrum is a way to restart the game after a minor infrigement.

Daily standup is a reasonable name, but it focuses more on how the participants are supposed to stand (up) during the meeting, which has its own reasons (to keep the meeting short) but nowhwere as interesting as to indicating the point of the meeting.

### Why this is an anti-pattern

This is an anti-pattern because it does not help the team work as a team. You want the team to be pulling in the same direction, and often the team members need to work together to accomplish the same goal.

When they are simply reporting status (which can be as effectively done by posting on a message board), each member is simply waiting for their turn to speak, not really interested in listening to the other members, and certainly not seeing the other members' struggle as their own.

At this point, rather than a team, this is an indication that we are listening from a group of people, who happen to work in similar areas.

### How to detect it

- Each person talks to the person in charge, instead of to each other
- If someone is struggling, the other members do not offer to drop what they are working on, to help the person. Especially important if it the struggling person is working on a higher priority.
- While members wait, and especially after they are done reporting, they appear checked out, and just waiting for the meeting to be over so they can go back to their desks.

### How to avoid it

Instead of focusing on activities (working on feature X, tested thing Y), instist on asking for what was *accomplished* yesterday, and what each person plans on *accomplishing* today. The focus on accomplishements rather than activities, will even gradually change how teams see the meeting. They will move from seeing it as a way to start the day by proving to the boss that we have been busy, to a way to plan as a team how we are going to complete the work we set up to.
