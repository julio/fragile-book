# Agile Interpretation

## No Design

### Misconception

Teams new to agile can sometimes believe that in agile there is no need to do any design. System or otherwise. 

This is then sometimes interpreted as a positive aspect, and sometimes as a negative one. Either way, it cannot be further from the truth.

In fact, with agile, design is so important that agile teams are constantly designing.

On an agile team, you are designing when you discuss a feature, you are designing when you pair program, you are designing when you retrospect, when you demo, when write unit tests.

The misconception is due to the fact that it is not recommended to have a Big Design Up-Front (the notorious BDUF), like in a more predictable approach such as Waterfall.

### Why this is an anti-pattern

When teams assume that they are not supposed to design, the process will devolve into "cowboy coding". A series of hacks until something seems to be working.

### How to avoid it

Insist that there is a lot of design, and that many ceremonies and activities are precisely about design.

And also resist a Big Design Up-Front, but not so much that there is no design at all upfront.

Have a brainstorm session, or planning, or a small team offsite, so everyone can align, and stop the design the moment the conversation switches to implementation details.

Everytime the answer to the question "would having more detail now, change the cost of the implementation" is "No", the team is designing too much.
