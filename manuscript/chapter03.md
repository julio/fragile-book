## NoPO

### The fragile pattern

A team without a dedicated Product Owner, sometimes also called Product Manager, or Main Stakeholder, or even "The Customer" is not so uncommon.

### Why this is fragile

This is problematic because the team does not have someone fully dedicated to representing the users of the product being built. Someone who can have deeper conversations with the potential users and customers, do market research, have enough infomration to understand what ought to be happen first, have a vision for where we the product is going.

This can be problematic and slow down the team, because there is no clear path forward, and certainly not a good representation of where the product should go. Decisions are more contentious, and at best decided by commmittee instead of representing actual needs.

### How to detect it

- Everyone on the team codes, no one is solely focused on the customers
- A side effect of this tends to be quality and focus of the work items. Inevitably these items will gravitate towards internal engineering tasks, instead of representing what customers need.

It's also common to hear "we don't have a product owner, because we are an internal tool". 

### How to avoid it

At the very least nominate one of the team members as the Product Owner, with everything that comes with it: prioritization power, interact with customers, set the vision for the product, code less (or not at all), expect demos, make quick decisions for the team when they are stuck.

Ideally have someone who is a Product Manager already to play the role of the Product Owner.

## ManyPOs

### The pattern

"We don't have just one person to act as the product owner"

Often the reason for this is the complexity of the product, other times it's the lack of resources, and other times it's the the distributed aspect of the team.

### Why this is fragile

Unless the individuals acting as product owners are in perfect harmony every minute of the day, or at least, whenever a decision is needed, or a question needs an answer, or something needs prioritizing, then having more than one product owner is going to slow down the team.

Inevitably they are going to contradict each other, and at the very least ask for more time before they can agree together on the right course of action.

This extra necessary is considered waste, and something to attempt to eliminate in order to enable the team to run as fast as they can.

### How to strengthen it

Bring this up during a retrospective, that hopefully all product owners also attend, and insist on a single Product Owner. Make sure to clarify that the reason for it is so the teamn ca deliver faster. Document any examples when the team was slowed down for lack of single Product Ownership.

The "new" Product Owner should be empowered to make the right calls, either on their own, or after consulting with the right stakeholders. Ultimately, it should abundantly clear to the team, that the Product Owner is the one in charge of representing the customers of the product, and it is their call, and not a committee's call. This is even if behind the scenes there is a commmittee (see #ProxyPO)
