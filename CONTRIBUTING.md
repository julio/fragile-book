# Contribution guidelines

## How to contribute

Feel free to improve the quality of this content by submitting **pull requests**. A merged PR will make you appear in the contributor list. It will, however, be considered a donation of your work to this project. You are still bound by the conditions of the license, meaning that you are not considered an author or owner of the content once it has been merged in.

You may also open **issues** for pointing out mistakes or suggesting ideas.

## Markdown flavor

Leanpub uses a specific flavor of Markdown. As much as possible, this book is written using GitHub-Flavored Markdown to improve rendering on GitHub and elsewhere, while staying compatible with Leanpub.

The only exceptions are info, tip, warning and error text boxes defined with `I>`, `T>`, `W>` and `E>` instead of the classic `>` syntax. Read the [Leanpub documentation](https://leanpub.com/help/manual#leanpub-auto-more-text-block-types) for more details.

## Translation guidelines

You are very welcome to translate this book. All translations are published under a common [GitHub organization](https://github.com/moretime). Please note that the original copyright and [license](LICENSE) still apply, so commercial use of any translated material is prohibited.

### Starting a new translation

Create an issue in this repository to define your target language, mentioning @julio in the issue's body. I will create the corresponding repo and a new translation team, then add you to it.
