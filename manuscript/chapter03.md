# Roles

## NoPO

### The fragile pattern

A team without a dedicated Product Owner, sometimes also called Product Manager, or Main Stakeholder, or even "The Customer" is not so uncommon.

### Why this is fragile

This is problematic because the team does not have someone fully dedicated to representing the users of the product being built. Someone who can have deeper conversations with the potential users and customers, do market research, have enough infomration to understand what ought to be happen first, have a vision for where we the product is going.

This can be problematic and slow down the team, because there is no clear path forward, and certainly not a good representation of where the product should go. Decisions are more contentious, and at best decided by commmittee instead of representing actual needs.

### How to detect it

- Everyone on the team codes, no one is solely focused on the customers
- A side effect of this tends to be quality and focus of the work items. Inevitably these items will gravitate towards internal engineering tasks, instead of representing what customers need.

It's also common to hear "we don't have a product owner, because we are an internal tool". 

### How to avoid it

At the very least nominate one of the team members as the Product Owner, with everything that comes with it: prioritization power, interact with customers, set the vision for the product, code less (or not at all), expect demos, make quick decisions for the team when they are stuck.

Ideally have someone who is a Product Manager already to play the role of the Product Owner.
