## StandupTooLong

### Fragile Pattern

There is no magic behind "15 minutes". A good 15-minute standup can in fact feel (and be) shorter than a bad 10-minute one.

Stand-ups, also known by their other name, scrum, are the team's opportunity to align on how they are going to come together as a team and figure out how to make solid progress towards the sprint goal.

This alignment can take longer than 15 minutes, but it rarely requires everyone on the team to be present to figure it out. And so the recommended guideline is for each person to share with everyone else what they could complete since last time they met, what they are planning to accomplish today, what is blocking them, and how expect to make progress.

### Why this is an anti-pattern

When stand-ups systemically take too long, it's natural for team members to tune out or even stop attending. At that point the team is no longer working as a team, but as a group of individuals reporting on the fact that they have been busy and deserve their paycheck.

Instead of a team of 6 people (for example), where when one person is in trouble, the whole team is in trouble, long stand-ups are a sign that we now have a 6 teams of one person, where other people's problems are not anyone else's problems.

### How to avoid it

Keep the stand-ups focused. No more than a minute per person. Ensure that everyone now knows what everyone else's challenges are, let them organize their day based on the new information, and reassess the next day.

Since standing up for long periods of time no longer hurts in this era of height-adjustable desks, try something different. Whomever speaks stands on one foot for example. Or have the stand-up in the parking lot during winter time. In other words, give the team an incentive to stay focused, yet informative.
